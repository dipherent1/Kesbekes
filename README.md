# Kesbekes AI-assisted Personalized Task Scheduler Project

## Kesbekes is a web application that uses a chatbot to help the user to schedule their activities and keep track of them.

The application is named Kesbekes (amharic for "step by step") to higlight the importance of slowly keeping track of activities
and applying the principles of time management with the assistance of an AI model. The program of this project does the following:
    
* Allow the user to sign in to their account or create a new one
* Verify if all entered credentials are authentic and correct
* Asks the user what their usual wakeup time, sleep time and productive hours are
  and stores the information to allow the chatbot to function accordingly
* After recieving information, it displays the home page where there are means to 
  add new tasks, contact the AI assistant, or display a calendar
* The first chatbot model helps to analyze the added task and processes the user's prompt
* The second chatbot model fetches a list of all tasks scheduled for the week and 
  compares the schedule-task request before responding to the user. 


This project is still in the prototype phase and hasn't included all planned features and the main code
is on the repository's master branch
